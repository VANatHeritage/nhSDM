nhSDM 0.0.5
================
2019-07-08

GENERAL CHANGES

* New library import: `fasterize`. Function `fasterize::fasterize` is 
now used in place of external GDAL rasterization for functions requiring
rasterization (nh_rasterize, internal `gRasterize` [nh_burn, nh_stack_resample]). 

* `nh_rasterize`: `pred.vals` and `priority` arguments now use the column names from `spf` 
as their value.

BUG FIXES

* `nh_stack_resample`: fixed issue due to naming of `levels` for the stack raster, affecting
usage where the input stack is directly from `nh_stack` (as opposed to loaded from a file).


nhSDM 0.0.4-3
================
2019-05-01

BUG FIXES

* `nh_stack`: Fixed bug affecting large-extent rasters

NEW FEATURES

* `nh_rasterize`: Added `priority` argument, for ordering features prior to rasterization. Higher values have preference. Default
behavior when `priority = NULL` is now set to order according to `pred.vals`.

nhSDM 0.0.4-2
================
2019-01-03

NEW FUNCTION

* `nh_stack_resample`: allows to create a reduced-resolution (coarser) raster version of a 
previously-generated stack (using `nh_stack`). It can also summarize species assemblages 
by polygons, using the `spf` argument.

nhSDM 0.0.4-1
================
2018-11-05

GENERAL CHANGES

* `sf` and `raster` to Depends

BUG FIXES

* `nh_sample`: Fixed bug with LINESTRING geometries; uses st_length as probability for sampling. 

nhSDM 0.0.4
================
NEW FUNCTION

* `nh_rasterize`: convert vector SDM predictions to raster, with optional buffer

nhSDM 0.0.3-1
=================
2018-08-13

BUG FIX

* internal function gRasterize had issues with overlapping/adjacent polygons - used union 
to combine them prior to writing to shapefile.

GENERAL

* `nh_best`: added argument `min.dist` to excludes areas from consideration within min.dist of 
`spf`, when given. Also re-arranged argument order for this function.

nhSDM 0.0.3
=================
2018-07-26

NEW FUNCTIONS

* `nh_proj`: create new SDM project with folder structure and database

* `nh_stack`: stack binary SDM rasters into a single layer, indentifying
unique assemblages

nhSDM 0.0.2
=================
2018-06-14

NEW FUNCTIONS

* `nh_patchdrop`: drop contiguous cell groups that are smaller
than a given size threshold

* `gRasterize`: internal function for spatial feature rasterizing. Now
uses `gdalUtils::gdal_rasterize` making `nh_burn` reliant on a valid GDAL install.

nhSDM 0.0.1-1
=================
2018-03-14

* New functions `nh_burn`, `nh_best`

* internal function script added.

nhSDM 0.0.1
=================
2018-02-08

** INITIAL RELEASE ON GITHUB **

* switched functions to use `sf` methods with `sp` support
